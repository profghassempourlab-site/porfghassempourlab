            <p>Three areas of separation and purification are being worked on by our laboratory: affinity chromatography (analytical and preparative), FPLC (analytical and preparative ), and HPLC (analytical and preparative).<br>
                We are prepared to offer services in the areas of preparation of pharmaceutical standards, vaccines, antibodies, peptides and Amino acids, anti-venom, synthesis of medicines, API from natural compounds, and optically active medicines. As well as being prepared to offer services in method development, quantitative, and qualitative analysis in order to produce medications on an industrial scale, we are also involved in modeling and scaling.</p>
